# Breast Cancer Classification (Machine Learning Project)

This project builds a Machine Learning model to classify breast cancer tumors as Malignant or Benign using the Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer Dataset from scikit-learn.

The project includes:
- Data loading  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Train–test split  
- Feature scaling  
- Model training (Random Forest Classifier)  
- Model evaluation using F1 Score, Classification Report, and Confusion Matrix
